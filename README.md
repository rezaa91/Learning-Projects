# Learning Projects
No emphasis on clean code here... This is just a playground of simple c++ projects written for educational purposes.
The main aims of this project is for me to learn the C++ language and its features.

# Areas covered
* precompiled headers
* User input & validation
* Generating random numbers
* Creating a static lib and using in another project
* matrix library
* Operator overloading
* Unit testing
* Exception handling
* File manipulation
* Array manipulation - mapping, filtering, reducing, sorting, finding...
* Template
* lambdas
* Functor
* static_assert

# Areas to still cover:
* C++ new features - std::optional, smart pointers, std::move, structured bindings, std::async (https://github.com/AnthonyCalandra/modern-cpp-features)
* Stop watch with pause, continue and reset functionality - chrono library
* static and dynamic casting
