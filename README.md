# Learning Projects
No emphasis on clean code here... This is just a playground of simple c++ projects written for educational purposes.
The main aims of this project is for me to learn the C++ language and its features.

# Areas covered
* precompiled headers
* User input & validation
* Generating random numbers
* Creating a static lib and using in another project
* matrix library
* Operator overloading
* Unit testing
* Exception handling
* File manipulation

# Areas to still cover:
* Todo list - with options to add, remove, update, view in different sorted structures
* XML extraction
* Array manipulation - mapping, filtering, reducing, sorting, finding...
* Stop watch with pause, continue and reset functionality
* Template / generics
* C++ new features - lambda, std::optional, smart pointers, std::move, std::filesystem, structured bindings, std::async (https://github.com/AnthonyCalandra/modern-cpp-features)
